# Noise-in-Nanofluidics

Here you can find a mini-project accompanying my work on _Noise in Nanofluidic Systems_. The theoretical results for the power spectra of number fluctuations, which are outlined in the main work (Eq. 12), are solved here. You can input parameters of your choice and solve to invetigate what the power spectra look like.

# How it works

This script is written in python using Google Colab. To solve the equations, first run the backend cells and the sandbox. Then, input your system parameters and click "Run Analysis". The calculated power spectra will appear below. To clear the graphs you have made, just click "Clear Output". Have fun exploring the behaviour of the PSDs!
