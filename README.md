# Noise-in-Nanofluidics

Here you can find a mini-project accompanying some of my work on _Noise in Nanofluidic Systems_. The theoretical results for the power spectra of number fluctuations, which are outlined in the main work (Eq. 12), are solved here. You can input parameters of your choice and solve to investigate what the power spectra look like.

## How it works

This script is written in python using Google Colab. GitHub doesn't support widgets, so there are two versions of the notebook: one [more user-friendly one with widgets](calculating-power-spectra-with-widgets.md), and one [without](calculating-power-spectra-no-widgets.ipynb). To solve the equations, first run the backend cells and the sandbox. Then, input your system parameters run the analysis. The calculated power spectra will appear below. Have fun exploring the behaviour of the PSDs!

## Version

This is V1.0, created by Anna Drummond Young.
